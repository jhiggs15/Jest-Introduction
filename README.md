# Getting Started with Jest

This project was created with create-react-app

The purpose of this project is to give a brief introduction to Jest in React. An important thing to note is that the goal of Jest isn't necessarily to test the state of components rather it's to test the publicly facing features your code gives to the users. 
To test custom hooks that rely on state, look into https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library
This project also just scratches the surface! Another cool feature provided to look into is https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing
